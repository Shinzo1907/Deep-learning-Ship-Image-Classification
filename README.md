# Deep-learning-Ship-Image-Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify different types of ships using deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can accurately identify the class of a ship from an image.

## Features
- Data Collection and Preparation
- Image Preprocessing and Augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Design and Training
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- Fine-Tune
- Prediction on test data

## Dataset
The dataset contains images of various ship types. The main features are:
- `Image`: The image of the ship
- `Class`: The class of the ship (e.g., Cargo, Tanker, Fishing, Passenger)

  
## Results
The model achieved the performance metrics:
- **F1 Score**: X.XX
